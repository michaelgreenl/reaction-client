## 📖 Overview
> A production-ready Node.js/Express API designed to securely manage user authentication, game statistics, and player settings with a focus on modular architecture and robust security standards.

Built on Node.js and Express, this API leverages PostgreSQL as its primary data store, orchestrated via Sequelize for object-relational mapping. The architecture strictly follows the MVC pattern extended with a Repository Layer, ensuring a clean separation between HTTP handling, business logic, and database interactions.

## ⚡ Technical Highlights
**Repository Pattern Implementation:** Database queries are abstracted away from Controllers into dedicated Repositories (`src/db/repositories`), promoting cleaner code and easier testing.

**Centralized Middleware Configuration:** Unlike typical Express apps that clutter `app.js`, this project aggregates middleware (CORS, Helmet, Rate Limiting) into a modular configuration array in `src/config/index.js`.

**Defense-in-Depth Security:** Implements meaningful security layers including `helmet` for header hardening, `express-rate-limit` for DDoS protection, and `express-slow-down` to mitigate brute-force attacks.

**Orchestrated Entity Initialization:** The User creation flow (`user.controller.js`) automatically provisions dependent resources (Stats and Settings) in a unified sequence, ensuring data consistency for new accounts.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Decisions 
**HTTP-only Cookies for Auth:** Instead of storing JWTs in LocalStorage (which is vulnerable to XSS), I use HTTP-Only. This decision prioritizes security over the slight convenience of client-side token access.

**Declarative App Entry Point:** `app.js` was intentionally kept minimal by offloading setup logic to `src/config`. This makes the application entry point readable at a glance and simplifies the addition of new global middleware.
